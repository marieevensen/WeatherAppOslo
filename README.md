# WeatherAppOslo

In this project we learned about using API, and retrieve data from this external source.
I have used a weather API, about the city Oslo. You can easily change the city by changing the name in the end of the API.

The project gives you:
- Name of the city.
- The degree in the city.
- A description of the weather and how strong the wind is.
- You can also see this information for the next three days too.

This project is very useful if you want to retrieve data from an API.
